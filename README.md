# File Processing Application

## Overview

This project is a simple Spring Boot application that processes an input file and generates an outcome file. It is designed to showcase familiarity with Spring Boot, Java, and adherence to SOLID principles.

## Stack

- Java 11
- Spring Boot

## Scenario

You are developing a system that takes a file (defined below) and processes it to create an 'Outcome file'. The system can be triggered via REST by passing the initial file or by triggering a start. Validation of the file is important, but there's also a feature flag to skip validation. Once the outcome file is created, it is passed back to the user.

### Initial File (EntryFile.txt)

- Type: TXT
- Content:

### Outcome File (OutcomeFile.json)

- Type: JSON
